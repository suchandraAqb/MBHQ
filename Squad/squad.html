                This app allows you to create circuits with multiple stations and rounds in it.
            </div>
              
            <div style='color: #202020;font-size: 17px;line-height: 25px;font-weight: 500;margin-bottom: 90px;'>
                There are 3 modes:
                </div>
               <ol>
               <li><span style='font-weight:600;'>Default:</span> All rounds are the same setting.</li>
                   
                   <li><span style='font-weight:600;'>Round Mode:</span> You can change the station length or the rest period length of each round so in round 1 each station could be 20 seconds with 5 seconds rest, while in round 2 each station could be 40 seconds with 10 seconds rest.</li>
                   
                     <li><span style='font-weight:600;'>Station Mode:</span>This allows you to choose the length of each station in each round. This gives you the Ultimate flexibility in your circuit design. Station 1 could be a plank for 60 seconds, but station 2 could be chin ups for 20 seconds. This mode takes longer to set up, but allows you to create amazing circuits.</li>
        
        
                  </ol>
              
        
            <div style='color: #202020;font-size: 17px;line-height: 25px;font-weight: 500;margin-bottom: 20px;'>
                There are 3 Sound Modes
                </div>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style='font-weight:600;'>Music:</span>Chose your fav playlist from itunes or spotify and have this play along in the background.
                    <ol>
                       <li>In rest periods you can chose for the music to get softer, turn off or keep playing. (if the music goes softer this allows you to know when to rest and when to work).</li>
                       </ol>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <span style='font-weight:600;'>Voice Over:</span>
                       This feature has ashy talking. And stations longer than 30 seconds will have Ashy giving you some motivation while you train which is super helpful when you are training by yourself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style='font-weight:600;'>Bell:</span>
                           If voice over is OFF, then a bell will ring to start a station and a buzzer will buzz to signify a rest.
                    </li>
                </ol>
             
             <div>
                The options are endless, but with the Ashy Bines Circuit timer you can create an endless amount of circuit variations so when you hit the gym.

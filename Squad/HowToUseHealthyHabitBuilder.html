                <li style="font-size:16px;font-weight: 500;">The healthy habit builder has been designed to help you stay consistent and achieve your goals.
                    It allows you to connect with an accountability buddy or buddies and give them access to see your daily actions list (and you can see theirs).</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;font-weight: 500;margin-top:10px;">Each Action you add to the habit builder is also linked to your action list in the goals section and vice versa.
                    We have done this so that you get DOUBLE the accountability.
                    By using the actions list in goal setting you can create reminders that pop up and keep you accountable personally. When you add an accountability buddy as well this equals double accountability to your goals and a much higher chance of success.</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:2px;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:15px;background-color:#03A9F4;display:inline-block;color:#ffffff;"> STEP 1</li>
                <li>- Add a Action and decide how frequently you want to be accountable to this action
                    You probable want between 3 to 10 actions max that you are trying to stay consistent on and build into healthy habits.</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:2px;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:15px;background-color:#03A9F4;display:inline-block;color:#ffffff;">STEP 2</li>
                <li>- Click on the person icon and add the email address of the Squad Member you want to be buddies with (you can have more than 1)
                    - They need to approve your request before you can see their list</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:2px;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:15px;background-color:#03A9F4;display:inline-block;color:#ffffff;">STEP 3</li>
                <li>- Find your action in the Vision/Goals section (in achieve) and add a personal reminder to pop up daily. (this adds that double accountability we were talking about)</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:2px;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:15px;background-color:#03A9F4;display:inline-block;color:#ffffff;">STEP 4</li>
                <li>- Communicate with your buddy and decide how many days a week you will catch up (phone/skype or just messenger) to go over each others progress. There are a couple of good options here.
                </li><li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:8px"><b>a) Daily:</b>  This is for girls who really really want to stay accountable. Organise to chat at the end of the day for 5 minutes max. All you do is call and run through each others list. How did you go etc.
            - Knowing that each day you have to explain yourself and your actions is a great way to be accountable.
                </li><li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:8px"><b>b) Weekly:</b>  Organise a once a week call/skype but check in daily online and see how they are going. Send them messages of support or a kick up the butt through the messenger app so they know you are watching.

            Having someone to support and someone to support YOU on your goals is one of the best ways to stay accountable and create the new health habits that will not only get you results but ensure you keep them for life!!</li>

                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:10px;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:15px;background-color:#64e226;display:inline-block;color:#ffffff;">TIPS</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:8px"><b>1)</b> 
                  The little eye you see allows you to hide certain actions from your accountability buddy. This way you can still set private actions just for you that you might not be ready to share, and then also have other actions you want to be kept accountable to by a buddy.</li>
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:8px"><b>2)</b> 
            Do the mindset mastery course in the learn section of Squad. This will help you understand just why being consistent and creating healthy habits is the key to your long term success.</li>
            <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:8px"><b>3)</b> 
            When you get the push reminder to your phone click on it. It will open up the action and you can quickly tick off you have done it.  This makes it super easy to update your list and you don't have to keep reminding yourself to stay up to date
</li>  
                <li style="font-size:16px;margin-top:8px"><b>4)</b> 
                        Your conversations are also visible in the 'find a friend' section in CONNECT. So you can also just send them a message anytime you like from there too
